You manage the lifecycle of a Maestro session: view progress, resume paused work, abort a session, or pause a running one.

## Step 1: Read Session State

Read `.maestro/state.local.md`.

If the file does not exist or cannot be read:

```
No active Maestro session.

To start a new session:
  /maestro "describe your feature here"

To initialize Maestro for this project:
  /maestro init
```

Stop here.

## Step 2: Parse State

Extract all fields from the YAML frontmatter of `.maestro/state.local.md`:

- `active` — whether a session is running
- `feature` — the feature being built
- `mode` — yolo, checkpoint, or careful
- `layer` — execution or opus
- `current_story` / `total_stories` — progress
- `phase` — current phase (validate, delegate, implement, self_heal, qa_review, git_craft, checkpoint, paused, completed, aborted, decompose, research)
- `qa_iteration` / `max_qa_iterations`
- `self_heal_iteration` / `max_self_heal`
- `started_at` / `last_updated` — timestamps
- `token_spend` / `estimated_remaining`
- `session_id`
- `model_override`
- `branch` — git branch if recorded, otherwise read from `git branch --show-current`

If `layer` is `opus`, also extract:
- `opus_mode` — full_auto, milestone_pause, budget_cap, time_cap, until_pause
- `current_milestone` / `total_milestones`
- `milestones` — status map of all milestones
- `token_budget` / `time_budget_hours`
- `fix_cycle` / `max_fix_cycles`
- `consecutive_failures` / `max_consecutive_failures`

If `layer` is `opus`, also read `.maestro/roadmap.md` to extract the full milestone list with titles and per-milestone story counts for progress bar rendering.

## Step 3: Handle Subcommands

Check `$ARGUMENTS` for a subcommand.

### No arguments — show status

Read `.maestro/trust.yaml` for trust metrics.

Calculate time elapsed from `started_at` to now.

Read `.maestro/config.yaml` and check for an `integrations` section (e.g., `github`, `linear`, `slack`). Note which integrations are configured and their status.

Display comprehensive status using the template below.

**Progress bar rendering:** Use 16 characters total. Fill with █ proportional to completion, pad remaining with ░. Example: 4/8 stories → 8 filled, 8 empty → `████████░░░░░░░░`.

**Cost display:** Convert token counts to approximate dollar amounts using the active model's rate. Show `~$N.NN`. If cost data is unavailable, show the raw token count instead.

**Tokens display:** Show total tokens used in thousands (e.g., `145K used`).

**Time elapsed:** Format as `Xh Ym` (e.g., `2h 14m`). If under 1 hour, show `Nm` only.

```
+---------------------------------------------+
| Maestro Status                              |
+---------------------------------------------+
  Session   [session_id, first 8 chars]
  Feature   [feature name]
  Mode      [mode] | Layer: [layer]
  Branch    [git branch]
  Started   [started_at, human readable]

  Progress  [████████░░░░░░░░] [current_story]/[total_stories] stories ([N]%)

  Milestone [current_milestone]/[total_milestones]: [current milestone name, from roadmap]
  Story     [current story title]
  Phase     [current phase, human readable]

  Cost      ~$[N.NN] spent | ~$[N.NN] estimated remaining
  Tokens    [N]K used
  Context   [████████████░░░░] [N]% used ([N]K/[limit]K tokens)
            Compaction: auto (triggers at ~95%)
  Time      [elapsed time]

  QA Rate   [qa_first_pass_rate]% first-pass
  Trust     [trust_level]
+---------------------------------------------+
```

Notes for rendering:
- If `layer` is `execution`, omit the Milestone line entirely.
- If cost data is unavailable or `token_spend` is zero, show `Cost  (no data)`.
- If `estimated_remaining` is not set, omit that portion of the Cost line.
- **Context display:** Read the current session's token count to determine context usage. Calculate percentage as `(tokens_used / context_limit) * 100`. The context window limit for Claude is 200K tokens for standard sessions and 1M tokens for extended context sessions. Use 16-character progress bar (same rendering rules as the Progress bar). Show token counts in K (e.g., `145K/200K tokens`).
- **Context advisory:** If context usage is above 80%, append a warning after the Context line:
  ```
            (!) Above 80% — consider /compact or starting a new session
  ```
  If context usage is above 95%, the warning becomes:
  ```
            (!!) Critical — compact now or start a new session
  ```
- For `Phase`, map internal phase names to human-readable labels:
  - `validate`, `decompose`, `research` → Validate
  - `delegate` → Delegate
  - `implement` → Implement
  - `self_heal` → Self-heal
  - `qa_review` → QA review
  - `git_craft` → Git commit
  - `checkpoint` → Checkpoint
  - `paused` → PAUSED
  - `completed` → COMPLETED
  - `aborted` → ABORTED

After the box, if `layer` is `opus`, display a milestone summary table with ASCII progress bars. For each milestone, compute its bar based on stories completed within that milestone vs. total stories for that milestone (read from `.maestro/roadmap.md`). If per-milestone story counts are not available, use done/in-progress/pending status only.

```
  Milestones:
    M1  ████████████████ done     [milestone 1 title]
    M2  ████████░░░░░░░░ 50%      [milestone 2 title]
    M3  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ pending  [milestone 3 title]
```

Status labels:
- `done` — milestone fully completed
- `[N]%` — milestone in progress (percentage of its stories done)
- `pending` — not yet started

After the milestone table (or the main box if not Opus), show quick-action options based on state:

If session is active (not paused, not completed, not aborted):

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Session is active. What would you like to do?"
- Header: "Action"
- Options:
  1. label: "Pause", description: "Save state and pause for later resumption"
  2. label: "Abort", description: "End the session. Committed work is preserved."

If session is paused:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Session is paused. What would you like to do?"
- Header: "Action"
- Options:
  1. label: "Resume (Recommended)", description: "Continue from story [current]/[total]"
  2. label: "Abort", description: "End the session. Committed work is preserved."

If session is completed:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Session completed. What's next?"
- Header: "Next"
- Options:
  1. label: "Start new session", description: "Begin a new feature with /maestro"
  2. label: "View history", description: "See past sessions and cost analysis"

If the session is paused, also show:

```
  Session is PAUSED.
  Resume with: /maestro status resume
  Abort with:  /maestro status abort
```

If the session is completed, also show:

```
  Session COMPLETED.
  Start a new session with: /maestro "next feature"
```

### `resume` — Resume paused session

1. Re-read `.maestro/state.local.md` and verify `active: true` and `phase: paused`

2. If `active` is false or phase is not `paused`:
   ```
   Cannot resume: session is not paused.
   Current phase: [phase]
   ```
   Stop here.

3. Validate that the session is resumable:
   - Check that `.maestro/stories/` contains story files
   - Check that `current_story` is within range
   - Read the current story file to verify it exists

4. If Magnum Opus (`layer: opus`):
   - Check milestone state is consistent
   - Verify roadmap file exists
   - Load vision document for North Star re-injection

5. Update state:
   - Set `phase` back to the last active phase before pause (read from state or default to `validate` for current story)
   - Set `last_updated` to current timestamp
   - Keep `active: true`

6. Update the body text (after the `---` closing) to resume the dev loop:
   ```
   Continue Maestro dev-loop for story [current]/[total].
   Story: .maestro/stories/[NN-slug].md
   Phase: [phase] (resuming from pause).
   Mode: [mode].
   NORTH STAR: [feature description]
   ```

7. Display:
   ```
   Resuming Maestro session.

   Feature: [feature]
   Picking up: story [current]/[total] — "[story title]"
   Phase: [phase]
   Mode: [mode]

   Continuing...
   ```

8. The stop hook will pick up the updated state and continue the dev loop.

### `abort` — Abort session

1. Ask for confirmation using AskUserQuestion:

   Use AskUserQuestion:
   - Question: "Abort session? Committed work is preserved. Uncommitted changes for the current story remain in your working tree."
   - Header: "Confirm"
   - Options:
     1. label: "Yes, abort", description: "Mark session as aborted"
     2. label: "Cancel", description: "Go back, keep session active"

2. If confirmed:
   - Update `.maestro/state.local.md`:
     - Set `active: false`
     - Set `phase: aborted`
     - Set `last_updated` to current timestamp
   - Update the body text:
     ```
     Session aborted by user.
     Feature: [feature]
     Progress at abort: story [current]/[total], phase: [phase]
     ```
   - Update `.maestro/state.md` (persistent project state):
     - Log the aborted session with timestamp and progress

3. Display:
   ```
   Session aborted.

   Committed work is preserved (stories 1 through [last committed]).
   Any uncommitted changes for story [current] remain in your working tree.

   To start fresh: /maestro "new feature description"
   ```

### `pause` — Pause running session

1. Read current state. If `phase` is already `paused`:
   ```
   Session is already paused.
   Resume with: /maestro status resume
   ```
   Stop here.

2. If `active` is false:
   ```
   No active session to pause.
   ```
   Stop here.

3. Update `.maestro/state.local.md`:
   - Record the current phase as `paused_from: [current phase]` (store in frontmatter)
   - Set `phase: paused`
   - Set `last_updated` to current timestamp

4. Update the body text:
   ```
   Session paused by user.
   Feature: [feature]
   Story: [current]/[total]
   Paused from phase: [original phase]
   Resume with: /maestro status resume
   ```

5. Display:
   ```
   Session paused.

   Feature: [feature]
   Progress: story [current]/[total]
   Paused during: [original phase]

   Resume with: /maestro status resume
   Abort with:  /maestro status abort
   ```

## Important Notes

- The state file `.maestro/state.local.md` is the single source of truth for session state. Never rely on in-memory state across sessions.
- When resuming, always re-read `.maestro/dna.md` to ensure project context is fresh.
- The `trust.yaml` file is cumulative across all sessions — never reset it on abort or pause.
- When displaying token spend, format large numbers with commas (e.g., 145,230 tokens).
- Time elapsed should be calculated from `started_at` to the current time, not `last_updated`.
- If the state file exists but has corrupted or missing frontmatter fields, report the issue clearly and suggest running `/maestro init` to reset.
